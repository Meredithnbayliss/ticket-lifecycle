Ticket Assignment

Support agent Jane signs in. She opens the ticket and assigns the ticket priority, SLA Plan, and assigns it to the correct agent who can help. In this example, she communicates with agent John Doe and assigns this ticket to him.

Agent John works the issue and communicates back to agent Jane.

He also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved. Support agent Jane sees in her portal that agent John has left her a message and that the ticket is now closed:>

This was a very simplistic scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.

There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts.

I hope this tutorial helps you understand and have a better general overview of a life-cycle of a ticket. Help desk agents can expect to regularly deal with anywere between 10 to 100 tickets during their day depeneding on the company size.
